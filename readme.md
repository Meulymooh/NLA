## What is NLA ?

Noah's Little Ark is a pet rescue organization funded in 1993 by Silke Wrobel. It relies on a network of volunteers in the Chania area of Crete. They don't get any subsidies and survive solely on private donations (money, food, medicines and equipment).

## Why a website ?

I visited Crete in 2017 and was shocked to discover how many stray cats and dogs were wandering the streets in, many of them in bad shape and living in harsh conditions. Pet rescue has never been a priority in Greece, and only very few non-profits and shelters are present. 

I got in contact with NLA when trying to rescue a cat there and have been financially supporting them since then. Since they don't have a website, I thought it would be a good idea to offer my services to both help them and expand my portfolio in the meantime.
