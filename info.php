							<li><p>Don't feed the strays if they look okay. Not all pets wandering the streets are abandoned, and they might as well be fed by someone already.</p></li>
							<li><p>If you feed a stray anyway, do it at some distance from the hotels, as many owners don't like having pets hanging around too close.</p></li>
							<li><p>Give the strays appropriate food. Eg: don't feed them with bread or cow milk, as they won't digest it well.</p></li>

								<li><p>Go public as much as possible: write blog posts or newspaper articles, spread the word on Facebook and Twitter, etc. The world needs to know how bad it is for the strays in Greece, and how desperately in need of support Silke Wrobel and Noah's Little Ark are.</p></li>
