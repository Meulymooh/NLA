				<p>Founded in 1993 by <b style="color:#ed6a5a">Silke Wrobel</b> in Chania, Crete, <b style="color:#008B8B">Noah's Little Ark</b> is a welfare and rescue group composed of local citizens. They do their best to handle the medical emergencies, feed, treat, neuter/spay, foster and rehome the animals.<br><br>

				<b style="color:#ed6a5a">Silke Wrobel</b> is a well-known figure in the Municipality of Chania. Because there is no official shelter or animal infrastructures there, the local government turns to her to handle to most complicated emergency cases. Silke is also the only name to be found on the Internet when the locals and tourists want to report animals in need. At her place, Silke keeps and care for the neediest pets that are labour intensive (like abandoned newborns) until they're ready to be sent back to where they were found, or adopted.<br><br> 

				Taking care of the animals in distress comes with a cost. <b style="color:#008B8B">Noah's Little Ark</b> volunteers feed about 500 pets per day, and the medical expenses are also incredibly high since many cats and dogs need surgery and medicines.<br><br>

				<b style="color:#008B8B">Noah's Little Ark</b> doesn't get subsidies from the government and solely relies on donations. Without financial help, the situation of the strays in Chania would be even worse, and so much more can still be done for them!<br><br>
